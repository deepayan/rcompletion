 o completion after $ works on names().  This is not OK for non-list named 
   objects.  On the other hand, we want to be able to $ completion on other 
   objects that have a $method.  Not sure what the best approach would be.

 o what are the .__* things in S4 namespaces?  Need to filter these out.
