2006-11-11:

	added support for special completions inside library(), require()
	and data(); help completions after "?"; bumped version to 0.1-2

2006-11-10: 

	split rcompletion 0.0-12 into rcompletion_0.1-1 (readline binding)
	and rcompgen_0.1-1 (code to generate completions, possibly useful
	in contexts other than readline).  It is anticipated that further
	development will be restricted to rcompgen.
