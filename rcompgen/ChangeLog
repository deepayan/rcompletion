        Added ? as a non-breaker for .guessTokenFromLine()

2006-12-22:

	Disabled function checking by default, since that leads to loading
	of lazy loaded symbols all over the place.  Added a new unexported
	function .guessTokenFromLine() for backends that don't
	automatically do token determination.  Also added a
	proof-of-concept implementation of rcompgen-based completion for
	ESS in inst/examples/altesscomp.el
	
	
2006-11-11:

	added support for special completions inside library(), require()
	and data(); help completions after "?"; bumped version to 0.1-2

2006-11-10: 

	split rcompletion 0.0-12 into rcompletion_0.1-1 (readline binding)
	and rcompgen_0.1-1 (code to generate completions, possibly useful
	in contexts other than readline).  It is anticipated that further
	development will be restricted to rcompgen.
