/* 
   A note on environments: tentative completions are calculated using
   R code, and most of the code in this file is just a communication
   layer between R and readline.  For every completion attempt, R code
   has to be called for 3 distinct purposes (this is the way we do it,
   not the way it _has_ to be done): (1) make available to R
   information that it needs to compute possible completions, (2)
   evaluate the completions and (3) retrieve the completions.  These
   are done by constructing R function calls using the lang1 and lang2
   interfaces which are then evaluated using eval.  eval needs an
   environment.  This is where things get slightly tricky.

   Since these R functions are not of any use to the user, they are
   not exported.  This means that they won't be visible from
   R_GlobalEnv.  So, they should really be evaluated in the package
   environment.  Normally, that environment could have been passed as
   an argument from R in a .Call.  However, we are in the funny
   situation where the C code is called from a readline binding, not
   via .Call, so that solution won't work.

   What we use now is 

	rho = PROTECT(R_FindNamespace(mkString("rcompletion"))),

   See r-devel thread at
   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2006-October/039884.html
   for details.

     filenames contain things like $, % etc.  Might be possible to
     associate a M-/ override like bash does.  One compromise is that
     we exclude / from the breakers because that is frequently found
     in filenames even though it is also an operator.  This can be
     handled in R code (although it shouldn't be necessary if users
     surround operators with spaces, as they should).  */

  /* FIXME: quotes currently lead to filename completion without any
     further ado.  This is not necessarily the best we can do, since
     quotes after a [, $, [[, etc should be treated differently.  I'm
     not testing this now, but this should be doable by removing quote
     characters from the strings below and handle it with other things
     in 'specialCompletions()' in R.  The problem with that approach
     is that file name completion will probably have to be done
     manually in R, which is not trivial.  One way to go might be to
     forego file name completion altogether when TAB completing, and
     associate M-/ or something to filename completion (a startup
     message might say so, to remind users)

     All that might not be worth the pain though (vector names would
     be practically impossible, to begin with) */
